# Part I - Project Brief 
Interact with your assigned group and submit a project idea 
One person on the team should create the groupâ€™s Github repository, and the rest of the team should be added to the same repo.
Each team needs to come up with a web application that they would like to build and why. 
Also decide on the external API that you would be using. Here are some project examples/use-cases:
A game of chess
A localized weather application that displays the weather for each app based on the location you provide
An interactive UI for a music player
What to put in your proposal?
Team name & your members
One paragraph to summarize your idea
What External API you plan to use and why
Push the initial proposal in a PROPOSAL.md file to your group project page on GitHub. Submit the GitHub repo link to bCourses (1 submission per team)
We will take a look at initial drafts of the web application that you have chosen to build and comment on the feasibility of your project idea and return with comments
# Part II - Build the project
This is the part where you implement your web application using React. Happy Coding!

# Presentations to take place in-person during RRR week

Each team will have one repository where they will push their changes. Please use this new repository for all work on this project. 
This could be the first time where you are using GitHub while collaborating with others. Beware of merge conflicts and editing the same file with someone else.
git pull and fetch often
Create a structure for your project
Divide tasks systematically
Commit all changes in the repo
Prepare and deliver your project and a presentation
Prep for a 10 minute presentation
Limit your slides to 5 pages max. 
One of the slides must contain the functionality in bulleted form of your project
Your live demo must demonstrate the functionality mentioned in the slide deck. It is okay to say that you will add more functionality before the code is due, but what you say in the slide deck must be executed
Part III - Write about your learnings

Apart from the 5 slide presentation, make sure that your code is well commented.
Write a document on what you did and name it LEARNINGS.md. This should contain the following:
Team name & your members
What was your original goal and how much of it were you able to achieve?
A description of what your project does and the functionality that it provides
What did you learn from the project? Talk about the mistakes you made, challenges you overcame or the tools that you got to learn etc
