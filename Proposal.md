## Summery: 
Weather Wizards is a web application that offers a centralized platform for accessing real-time weather updates and air quality indices from various locations worldwide. It has been designed with a focus on user convenience and the growing demand for up-to-date environmental information. In today's era of climate change and rising air pollution levels, having access to accurate real-time data is increasingly crucial, and Weather Wizards addresses this need by delivering precise information and visualizations through an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

## APIs:
Here are the api's we might use in this project:   
Utilizing these APIs, we are able to display real-time data on air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 for each monitoring site. We can also provide data on temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed, thereby offering a comprehensive suite of weather and air quality information complemented by user-friendly visualization services.
