## Summary: 

We propose developing an AI-powered job portal frontend using React, JavaScript, and CSS. This project aims to enhance the job-seeking experience by integrating AI to provide more informative job listings. Key features include AI-generated job descriptions, user profiles, job search filters, and job alerts. The technology stack comprises React for the UI, integration with job listing APIs and a local storage for storing user profiles and saved job listings. The project will follow a 4-week timeline, including planning, development, testing, and deployment.

Our goal is to create a user-friendly and engaging job portal that empowers job seekers with comprehensive information and helps them make informed career decisions.

We seek approval to proceed with development and bring this innovative AI job portal to life.
